Full schema: `sql/carbure.sql` (MariaDB/MySQL, InnoDB, `utf8mb4`). Changes to an existing
database are in `sql/migrations/` and applied by `Migrator` (see
[Migrations](#migrations)).

## Tables { #tables }

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `users` | Accounts. `is_admin` grants the administrator profile; `language` the portal language; `theme` its theme (`system`: the system one, `light`, `dark`); `alert_threshold` the amount from which a new expense triggers a notification (`NULL` = disabled); `budget_threshold` the percentage of a category's monthly budget from which its expenses trigger an alert (50 to 200, 100 by default); `budget_alert_category` the category whose budget is watched by these alerts (`NULL` = all budgets, reset to `NULL` when the category is deleted); `last_login` the last successful login; `failed_logins` the consecutive failed logins and `locked_until` the end of the lockout (24 h after 5 failures). |
| `devices` | Mobile devices (APNs token for `ios`, FCM for `android`, `platform` = `ios` by default), registered at login. Deleted with the user, or when the push notification service reports their token as unregistered. | A device already registered for a user exempts them from two-factor authentication.
| `user_mfa` | Two-factor authentication of a user: TOTP `secret` (base32), `enabled` (0 until enrollment is confirmed by a first code), `last_step` the last accepted time step (a code can be used only once). Deleted with the user. |
| `mfa_recovery_code` | Two-factor authentication recovery codes: only the SHA-256 hash (`code_hash`) is stored, the row is deleted when used. Deleted with the user. |
| `mfa_trusted_browser` | Trusted browsers (6 months): SHA-256 hash of the cookie token (`token_hash`), `label` (User-Agent), `created_at`, `expires_at`, `last_used_at`. Deleted with the user, when their password changes or when their two-factor authentication is disabled or reset. |
| `user_browser` | Web browsers of the portal logins: SHA-256 hash of the token of the `carbure_browser` cookie (`token_hash`, unique per user: several users of the household share the cookie of a browser), `label` (User-Agent), `created_at`, `last_login`. Forgotten after 6 months without a login or when the user asks, deleted with the user. Neither notifications nor exemption from two-factor authentication. |
| `user_notification` | Channels chosen by a user for a notification type (`kind`: `sync`, `rule`, `expense`, `budget`): `push` to their devices, `email` to the address in their profile. With no row for a type: push yes, email no, except `budget` (neither). Deleted with the user. |
| `budget_alert` | Budget alerts sent: one per user, category and month (`month`, first day), with the budget (`budget`), the expenses (`spent`) and the percentage (`percent`) at the time of the alert. A new alert is sent only if the month's budget exceeds the one already alerted. Deleted with the user or the category. |
| `api_tokens` | Access tokens of AI agents (MCP server): only the SHA-256 hash (`token_hash`) is stored, `token_hint` (start of the token) is used to recognize it; `expires_at` `NULL` = no expiration. A token obtained through OAuth carries its `client_id` and the hash of its refresh token (`refresh_hash`); `client_id` `NULL` = created in the portal. Deleted with the user. |
| `oauth_clients` | AI agents registered through OAuth (RFC 7591): `client_id`, secret hash (`NULL` for a public client, PKCE only), name and allowed redirect URIs (JSON array). |
| `oauth_codes` | Pending OAuth authorization codes (SHA-256 hash, PKCE `S256` challenge, 5 minutes, single use); deleted with their client or their user. |
| `bank_backend` | Name given to a bank connection (woob backend, e.g. `bnp_2` → "Joint account"), displayed instead of the bank name; with no row, the bank name is displayed. The credentials stay with woob. |
| `bank_account` | Bank accounts followed by the household: `account_number@bank_name` forms the `bankId` passed to woob; `label` is the name given to the account ("Joint account", `NULL` = "BANK ···1234"). `user_id` is the user who added the account ("Added by"); `last_sync_at`, `last_sync_status`, `last_sync_message` describe the last sync. Uniqueness on `(account_number, bank_name, user_id)`; the API also rejects an account already followed by the household. |
| `bank_transaction` | Transactions. The unique `uuid` is used for deduplication; `bank_name` and `account_number` indicate the source synced account (or the account read from an imported statement, `bank_name` `NULL`), `NULL` for transactions saved before they were added; `user` = first user who added the account (`MIN(user_id)`), with no effect on visibility; deleting the user is forbidden as long as they have transactions (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`); `transaction_date` index on `date`. |
| `bank_transaction_deleted` | Transactions deleted by a user (`uuid`, `deleted_at`, `user_id` set to `NULL` if the user is deleted): sync and statement import ignore these UUIDs, so a deleted transaction does not come back. |
| `bank_transaction_category` | Hierarchical categories (`parent_category`, `0` = root). Category `0` "Uncategorized" (`HORS-BUDGET`) is created by the installation and protected. |
| `bank_transaction_category_keyword` | Rules: keywords (in uppercase) searched for in labels to categorize automatically; `notify` = each new matching transaction is reported to the household. |
| `budget` | Budget of a category for a month (unique per category and date), as `DECIMAL(10,2)`. |
| `budget_insight` | Insights: SQL query returning an `amount` column, with the `{month}` and `{year}` placeholders replaced by integers; `icon` (Material icon, optional) and `color` (13 colors). |
| `settings` | Settings changed from the portal (`mcp_enabled`). |
| `schema_migrations` | Applied migrations and their date; created by `sql/carbure.sql` (version `2026-10-13_base`) or by `Migrator`. The schema version is the last recorded migration. |

## Migrations { #migrations }

The version 1.0 migrations (`2026-10-03_audit` to `2026-10-13_rule_notify`: administrator
rights, alerts, `utf8mb4`, sync status, API tokens, settings, last login, lockout, rule
notifications) are built into `sql/carbure.sql` and have been removed from the repository.
A database created from `sql/carbure.sql` has version `2026-10-13_base`.

The following migrations are in `sql/migrations/`, each with its
`-- applied-if: <query>` line, which makes it possible to recognize a migration that has
already been applied (by hand, or by `sql/carbure.sql`). See
[Development](developpement.md#migrations-de-base).

| Migration | Change |
|---|---|
| `2026-10-14_oauth` | OAuth for AI agents: `oauth_clients` and `oauth_codes` tables, `client_id` and `refresh_hash` columns of `api_tokens` |
| `2026-10-15_transaction_bank` | Source bank and account of a transaction (`bank_transaction.bank_name`, `account_number`) |
| `2026-10-16_bank_account_label` | Name given to a followed account (`bank_account.label`) |
| `2026-10-17_bank_backend_label` | Name given to a bank connection (`bank_backend` table) |
| `2026-10-18_transaction_deleted` | Deleted transactions, no longer re-imported (`bank_transaction_deleted` table) |
| `2026-10-19_user_theme` | Portal theme (`users.theme`) |
| `2026-10-20_user_notification` | Channels of each notification (`user_notification` table) |
| `2026-10-21_user_budget_threshold` | Budget alert threshold (`users.budget_threshold`) |
| `2026-10-22_budget_alert` | Budget alerts sent (`budget_alert` table) |
| `2026-10-23_user_budget_alert_category` | Budget watched by budget alerts (`users.budget_alert_category`, `NULL` = all) |

## "Household" model { #modele-foyer }

All data (accounts, transactions, budgets, categories, insights) is shared by the users.
`bank_account.user_id` and `bank_transaction.user` indicate who added the synced account,
without restricting visibility. Only devices, access tokens and preferences (language,
theme, alert thresholds, notification channels, budget alerts sent) are specific to each
user.

## Known limitations { #limites-connues }

- `budget_insight` stores SQL executed by the server: it is restricted (administrators
  only, forbidden keywords, budget tables only, read-only transaction limited to 5
  seconds), but indicators defined in the code would be safer. An insight query written
  with `MONTH(date)` / `YEAR(date)` does not use the date index: prefer a range.
